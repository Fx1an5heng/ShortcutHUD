# shortcut_overlay/foreground_monitor.py
"""
Monitors the active foreground window on Windows to detect application changes.

This module periodically checks which window is in the foreground,
determines the executable name of the associated process, and emits a signal
when the active application changes. This allows the overlay to display
application-specific shortcuts. This module is Windows-specific due to its
reliance on `pywin32` for interacting with the Windows API.
